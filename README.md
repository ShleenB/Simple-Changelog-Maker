Simple Changelog Maker 

Creates a simple changelog for file systems, assumes that only it and other changelog .txt files are in the folder with it.
The changelog generated will contain a date, ID number, and the 'Changes' and 'To Do' sections for you to fill in.
if the changelog already exists (ie. you've already generated a changelog today), you will be prompted on whether you want to override the created file or not.

A simple project to help practice Batch Script in Windows.
